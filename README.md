# Facebook Image Metadata Remover

Recently I found out that [Facebook puts IPTC metadata tags in all images that are downloaded from the platform.](https://twitter.com/oasace/status/1149181539000864769) It is unclear, what purpose they serve, 
some speculate they are used for tracking purposes, to connect online identities, for advertisement or copyright integrity.
I coded this simple solution that detects and removes the embedded Facebook metadata from a image.
